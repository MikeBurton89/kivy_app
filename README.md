# kivy_app
Simple app that should fetch the user location and find the nearest place that has a diaper changing spot, the various spots must be inserted by users.
I created a database to store all the adresses, that I want to fetch and geocode using googlemaps API.
Then a simple user interface using Kivy, a big button in the middle that when pressed should start all the geocoding and searching for the spot and three buttons on the bottom to do various things(still working on what those should do).

The interface was written using a file.kv

Still a work in progress.

Still there's a lot completely missing, such as the interface to insert addresses in the database and a map integration.
